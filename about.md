Hi, I'm a tinkerer, musician and web developer in the San Francisco, Bay Area.

I'm currently a Mac Support Specialist at the Academy of Art University, and in my free time I work on games, visual art and music.

You can find a more extensive rundown of my background and experience on LinkedIn.

And you can see a little more about my [current projects.](/#work)
